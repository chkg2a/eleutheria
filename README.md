We saw a problem in our global economy. Money that you worked hard for, can easily be controlled and regulated and making it hard for you to purchase any form of content. 

Payments made via credit card / bank can be regulated or can be easily censored or blocked. You ultimately don't have the control over what you own, your single most valuable asset money. Which is why, Blockchain can be used to make such payments hassle free and can be used for payments without any regulation or censorship from the government.

Our platform allows users to pay via crypto currency using blockchain technology. Ultimately, you decide where the money goes, and no one can stop you from making such purchases unless illegal materials are used. Anyone on the platform can upload an image, video without any censorship and we allow creators to get paid for their works and contents via cryptocurrency.
